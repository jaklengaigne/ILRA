Iterative Literature Review Approach 

## Context

This project aim to propose an approach to answer the dreading literature review: when do you stop?
To achieve that, we use an iterative keyword search method.

This work is based on initial coding and testing by https://github.com/Valirou on our barbapapa project https://github.com/jaklengaigne/rjs_litterature_mining.


## Approach

1. keyword
2. collect and count
3. repeat

## How to run

The code was developped using Anaconda.

### Jupyter notebook

After downloading the repository, start Jupyter in your terminal (e.g. anaconda prompt)

> jupyter notebook
or 
> jupyter lab
